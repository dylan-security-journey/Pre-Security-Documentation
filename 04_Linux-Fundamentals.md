## Introduction

Linux is just another operating system helps power cars, devices, appliances, servers

## A bit of Background on Linux

Linux is a lot more intimidating to approach than OS's like windows, critical infrastructure like traffic controllers, websites

Linus is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's basex on UNIX (another operating system), Linux comes in all shapes and sizes, suited best for what systems used for, founded 1991

## Running your first few commands

echo: output any text that we provide (helps with debugging) (if you don't have spaces no need to do quotes)

whoami: tells us user we're logged into

using terminal is purely text based since no GUI

In image above, shows me understanding how to go change directory, using ls to figure out what is on the system, from there ls folders to see file, cat folders to see it's content, and cd folder and pwd to find new current working directiory

## Searching for Files

find helps look for specific files, * help search for anything with (.txt)

grep to search entire contents of this file for any entries of the value we are searching for

## An Introduction to Shell Operators

&: allows to run commands in background of terminal

&&: allows combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal

(>): redirector, take output from command and direct it elsewhere

(>>): appends output rather than replacing (nothing is overwritten)

Playing with operator redirector and noticing the difference between overwritten and not overwritten
