## What is DNS?

Domain Name System provides simple way to communicate with devices on internet through IP address (Ex. 104.26.10.229), 4 sets of digits ranging from 0-255, complicated to remember set of numbers so remembering website domains like www.etc.com is easier

## Domain Hierarchy

TLD (Top-Level Domain): righthand part of domain name like (.com), two types of TLD which is gTLD (Generic Top Level) & ccTLD (Country Code Top Level domain)

gTLD: meant to tell purpose of domain name like commercial, education, government

ccTLD: geographic purposes

Second-Level Domain: first half before the (.com) for example (tryhackme) is second level but limited to 63 characters including TLD, only use a-z, 0-9, and no consecutive hyphens or start/end with them

Subdomain: Sits on left-hand side of second-level domain where a period separates it like (admin.tryhackme.com), same creating restrictions as second-level domain characteristics, usage of multiple subdomains splits with periods to create longer names (pluckers.admin.tryhackme.com) (253 characters or less), no limit to subdomains you can create
